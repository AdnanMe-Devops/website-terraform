Delete the ELB security group using the destroy command and the target option, and enter yes to accept the plan:

terraform destroy -target=aws_security_group.elb_sg


To destroy the target resource, all the resources that depend on the target must also be destroyed. You can see the ELB security group highlighted in the following dependency graph:



All of the resources above the security group are the ones that are destroyed. The web_sg security group depends on the elb_sg because it has a rule that only allows traffic from the elb_sg security group.

 

2. Run the plan command to verify that destroying resources doesn't affect  desired configuration:


terraform plan


The plan is to add back the resources you just destroyed. This may be what you want if a resource is modified outside of Terraform and it can't be brought back to the desired state requiring you to destroy and recreate it. If you actually no longer need a resource,  should remove it from the configuration.

 

3. Destroy all the remaining resources managed by Terraform, and enter yes when prompted:


terraform destroy


6. Press ctrl+c to stop the watch command..
